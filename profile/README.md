The Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago is a nonprofit research institute focused on building engineering technologies to measure biological processes, with a specialization towards human tissue and inflammation. We are dedicated to using these measurements to find the “tipping points” that cause inflammatory disorders.  We work both on a local scale with the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and nationally within the CZ Biohub Network. As part of the Chan-Zuckerberg inititiative, our work will be freely available to all scientists.
