[The Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago](https://www.czbiohub.org/chi) is a nonprofit research institute dedicated to building new engineering technologies for precise, molecular-level measurements of biological processes within human tissues, with a focus on immunology. Our ultimate goal is to understand and treat inflammatory states that underlie many diseases. We unite leading academic institutions (the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) with CZ Biohub Chicago's innovative research team to pioneer a unique, engineering-driven approach to studying human biology. As a key member of the CZ Biohub Network, created and supported by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, we work to accelerate scientific discovery and advance human health. Our work will be freely available to all scientists.
